        Kajiura was born on August 6, 1965, in Tokyo, Japan. She has been into
        music since 1972 and accompanying her father on the piano. Her family
        later moved to West Germany because of her father's work. Kajiura wrote
        her first composition when she was seven years old titled " Thank you,
        Good-bye" as a farewell for her grandmother before leaving Japan.
        Kajiura moved back to Japan when she was in middle school and later
        graduated from college. She began working as a systems engineering
        programmer until 1992 that she decided to focus more on music.

        "Sis puella magica!" by 梶浦由記 (Yuki Kajiura) (Ft. Eri Itoh) is a song
        that embodies a mystical and enchanting atmosphere, with its Latin
        lyrics evoking a sense of mystery and otherworldly beauty. The title
        itself, which translates to "Sister Magical Girl," hints at themes of
        sisterhood, magic, and a fantastical realm where extraordinary forces
        are at play.

        The ship of fools is an allegory, first appearing in Book VI of Plato's
        Republic, about a ship with a dysfunctional crew. The allegory is
        intended to represent the problems of governance prevailing in a
        political system not based on expert knowledge.
